# ML4QS
This is the code for the ML4QS in VU Amsterdam MSc Computer Science.

Recently, the sensory data from subjects were widely used in predicting human behavior through using multiple machine learning methods. Considering the quantified self data is still worth to analyze in-depth, we proposed to describe an exquisite pipeline of data preprocessing, feature engineering and feature selection. Then, typical machine learning methods and an ensemble model were evaluated and compared based on the result of prediction.
